# AI-FINAL-PROJECT
Week 8
Project Title: AI-Powered Health Monitoring System
üß† Project Overview
Title: AI-Powered Health Monitoring System Goal: To develop a smart system that continuously monitors users' vital signs using wearable devices and predicts potential health risks using AI models.

üîç Objectives
Collect real-time data such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels from wearables.

Use machine learning to detect anomalies and predict potential medical conditions.

Send alerts to users or healthcare providers in case of irregularities.

Visualize historical trends in user health data via a user-friendly dashboard.
