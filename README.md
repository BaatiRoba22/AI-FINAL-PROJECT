# Simulate health data for 100 users over 7 days
num_users = 100
num_days = 7

data = []

for user_id in range(1, num_users + 1):
    timestamp = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=num_days)
    for _ in range(num_days * 24):  # hourly readings
        # Simulated vitals
        heart_rate = random.randint(55, 110)  # bpm
        systolic_bp = random.randint(100, 140)

  Examples: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Regression**: Predict continuous vitals (e.g., blood pressure drift)  
  Examples: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Detect trends or predict future vitals  
  Examples: LSTM, GRU, Prophet

---

### 📊 Recommended Models by Use Case

| Task                      | Suggested Models                     | Why It Works                                           |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| Interpretability Needed   | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree   | Easy to explain to doctors or regulatory bodies        |



### 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Use these to choose the best model:
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall** for classification
- **MAE, RMSE** for regression tasks
- **AUC-ROC curves** to compare performance
- **SHAP values or LIME** for model explainability

- Sure thing! Here’s a simple Python example using **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies in simulated health data—say, to spot abnormal heart rate readings that could indicate a health risk:

---

## 🩺 Python: Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate sample health data
np.random.seed(42)
normal_heart_rates = np.random.normal(loc=75, scale=10, size=500)  # Normal readings
anomalies = np.random.uniform(low=150, high=180, size=5)            # Extreme outliers
heart_rates = np.concatenate([normal_heart_rates, anomalies])

df = pd.DataFrame({'heart_rate': heart_rates})

# Apply Isolation Forest
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)  # ~1% expected outliers
df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(df[['heart_rate']])

# -1 indicates anomaly
anomalies_detected = df[df['anomaly'] == -1]
print(f"Detected anomalies:\n{anomalies_detected}")

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(df['heart_rate'], label='Heart Rate')
plt.scatter(anomalies_detected.index, anomalies_detected['heart_rate'], color='red', label='Anomaly')
plt.title('Anomaly Detection in Heart Rate')
plt.xlabel('Reading Index')
plt.ylabel('BPM')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

---

## 🔍 What This Shows

- **Isolation Forest** separates anomalous data points based on feature isolation.
- In this case, heart rates significantly above the normal range are flagged.
- You can easily expand this to multiple features (e.g., blood pressure, SpO₂) or time-series windows.


## 🏋️ 4. Model Training and Evaluation

### 🔄 Step 1: Data Preparation
Before training, ensure your data is clean and ready:
- Normalize numerical features (e.g., heart rate, temperature)
- Handle missing values (impute or drop)
- Encode categorical variables if present
- Split data: `train_test_split()` with 70–30 or 80–20 ratio

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df.drop(columns='risk_label')  # input features
y = df['risk_label']               # output target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

---

### 🤖 Step 2: Train the Model
Pick one or more models from your selection (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost):
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Evaluate the Model
Use classification metrics to assess how well the model performs:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, roc_auc_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

### 📈 Optional: Visualize Performance
You can plot a confusion matrix or ROC curve for added insight.
```python
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay, RocCurveDisplay

ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test)
RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test)
```

---

### 📌 Pro Tips
- Use **cross-validation** for more robust model estimates
- Track **feature importance** to explain predictions
- Apply **early stopping** or regularization if you're training deep models

Absolutely—now it’s time to bring all that backend brilliance into the hands of users. Let’s design a functional and engaging **User Interface (UI)** for your AI-Powered Health Monitoring System:
